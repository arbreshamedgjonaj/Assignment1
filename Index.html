    <h1>My Diary </h1>
    <h2>Week 1 - 15.01.24</h2>    <h3>Meet and Greet </h3>
    <p>At the first day we meet with the teacher and the other participant.
        I was a bit excited to start teaching again after a long time.
        <br>
        I found the meeting very informative and the participants very nice. 
        <br>
        During the breaks, we were able to get to know each other better and 
        immediately made friends. 
        After lunch we opened a Whatsapp group and exchanged numbers.
    </p>
    <p>On wednesday we got our first assignment and teaching material. 
        Studying is more complicated than I hoped because 
        I don't have a kindergarten place for my daughter yet.
    </p>
    <p>In this week we focus in HTML und GIT. 
        <h4>To do's : Read, reapeat and reapet again!!!</h4>
        When I read the first material abaut How the internet and web works
        I can remember the terms from my studys. I have a little bit trouble to koncentrate
         and i must repeat reading the same material a couple of time to understand 
         and use them after I start this assisment.
