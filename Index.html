            <p style="color: rgb(67, 28, 104);">At the first day we meet with the teacher and the other participant.
                I was excited to start teaching again after a long time.
                <br>
                I found the meeting very informative and the participants very nice. 
                <br>
                During the breaks, we were able to get to know each other better and 
                immediately made friends. 
                After lunch we opened a Whatsapp group and exchanged numbers.

        <section id="section2">
            <p>On wednesday we got our first assignment and teaching material. 
                Studying is more complicated than I thought because 
                I don't have a kindergarten place for my daughter yet. So I must somehow
                have a workaround with my daughter.

            <p>
                In this week we focus in HTML and GIT. 
                <br>
                
                When I red the first material abaut How the internet and web works
                I can remember the terms from my studys. I have a little bit trouble to koncentrate
                 and i must repeat reading the same material a couple of time to understand 
                 and use them after I start this assisment.
